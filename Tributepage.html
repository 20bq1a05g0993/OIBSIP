        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, to a
          Canadian mother and South African father. He attended the University
          of Pretoria for a few months before moving to the United States to
          attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he received undergraduate
          degrees in economics and physics.

          After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Musk co-founded
          web software company Zip2 with his brother, which was later sold to
          Compaq for almost $300 million. He then founded X.com, an online
          payment company that eventually became PayPal, which was acquired by
          eBay for $1.5 billion.
